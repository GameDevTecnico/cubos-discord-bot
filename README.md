# Cubos Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot we use to remind ourselves of pending review requests!

To set it up, you must create both an application in both Discord and GitHub. Then you should fill the parameters in the `.env` file (copy it from `.env.example`), and also place the GitHub App private key in the working directory, with the name `github.pem`.
